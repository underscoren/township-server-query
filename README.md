# township-server-query
### A "A Township Tale" server query app

In order to run it, all you need to do is to clone the github repo and open up index.html in a modern web browser.

### API key

In order to be able to access the API, you need to get an API key. Ask Timo_Alta#8750 on the [discord](https://discord.gg/townshiptale) for one, or find it yourself.

Once you get it, open up main.js and put it into the `api_key` variable.
